						<h2>THE GRANT</h2>
						
          <p>On October 1, 2014, the U. S. Department of Labor awarded a $14.9 million Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training to Montgomery College and 13 other community colleges within the State of Maryland for performance period of 3 years. This project will address the challenges of a lack of adequate pool of skilled cyber workers, the shortage of laboratory facilities to support cyber training, a lack of training in flexible modalities, and barriers to learning for under served populations. </p>
          <p>The award of the CPAM grant was announced at the White House by Vice President Joe Boden, U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez and U.S. Secreatry of Education Arne Duncan in a ceremony that represented a $450 million investment of federal funding for community colleges throughout the nation. </p>
          <p>"This is an exciting day for Montgomery College, our 13 partner institutions and for the state of Maryland," said Dr. DeRionne P. Pollard, president of Montgomery College. "Together with these funds and our employer partners, Montgomery College and Maryland's community colleges can enhance our efforts to attack the skills gap--connect more of our residents to good jobs and fuel our economy with workers ready with 21st century skills.</p>
          <p>Maryland is a national center of cybersecurity with over 130,000 IT jobs-49% above the national average-yet many workers find these careers difficult to enter. The grant creates the Cyber Technology Pathways Across Maryland (CPAM) Consortium consisting of 14 of the state's community colleges to spearhead the expansion of career pathways to address this workforce need--deepen our work to close the skills gap and connect more residents to high-quality employment. </p>

          <p>More Features of the CPAM Consortium Include: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Enhances access to postsecondary education, both credit and noncredit, for Maryland residents</li>
            <li>Collaboration with major industry leaders such as Lockheed Martin and organizations such as the Tech Council of Maryland </li>
            <li>Enhances workforce development for a leading industry sector for Montgomery County and Maryland </li>
            <li>Addresses a significant skills gap for a leading industry sector in the state and local economy (Currently, 20,000 cyber jobs are available but employers cannot find prepared Marylanders to fill these high-quality jobs) </li>
            <li>Demonstrates the value of Maryland's community colleges in building an educated and skilled workforce--responding to the needs of employers across industry sectors to match residents with skills for in-demand careers </li>
          </ul>
						
						
          <p>
"The $15 million in investments in Maryland announced today will help prepare local workers with the skills needed for in-demand careers and advance the role of community colleges as engines of economic growth," said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. "Over the last four years, the U.S. Department of Labor has invested nearly $27 million in Maryland - part of a long-term commitment to ensure that workers have access to training for the specific skills employers need to stay competitive in the global economy.
